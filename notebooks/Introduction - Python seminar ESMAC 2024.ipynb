This seminar is hardly enough for you to learn Python, but it provides the basic knowledge needed to get started. <br>\n",

Followed by the collections that can be used to store multiple variables, loops and condition statements. Input statement to load data from documents, and save data back into another file format. Lastly, Python functions are being discussed."

The advantage of Jupyter notebook or Google Colab is that you can run cell by cell to see where you are going wrong.

Copy past your code, and visually see what happens. When using IDEs like PyCharm, DataSpell, ect, there is a debugging button.

    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradime based on objects or data rather than functions. This is approach is well suited for projects that are large and complex. <br>\n",
    "The structure of OOP makes it exceptionally suited for collaborative development and code usability. Movement science project often have different aspects to them. Starting with extracting the data, some preprocessing steps, possible filtering or normalisation, the actual analysis e.g. step detection; and calculating the outcome variables. All these different components of a movement science project could be considered **modules**. When used correctly, OOP simplifies the relationships within the project, however, it might be hard to start with, as most programming is taught using a functions approach. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects you'd want to manipulate and how they relate to each other. The structure of OOP is as follows:\n",
    "1. Classes\n",
    "    - The blueprints that models real-life object\n",
    "2. Objects\n",
    "    - The individual objects that are generated from the blueprint\n",
    "3. Attributes\n",
    "    - The characteristics/variables that define the objects\n",
    "4. methods\n",
    "    - The functions of the objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is currently one of the most popular programming languages that is build around Object-Oriented Programming. The telltale use of the code has the structure of **object.method()**. For example: `my_array.max()`---find the maximum value in the array; or `my_dataframe.head()`---displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame. Here, you have the object `my_dataframe` or `my_array` that is constructed from the class Array or DataFrame and using the functionality of the methods like `max()` or `head()`, the data can be manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know a bit about OOP, we can apply this knowledge on working with data.

Copy past your code, and visually see what happens. When using IDEs like PyCharm, DataSpell, ect, there is a debugging button.

    "The structure of OOP makes it exceptionally suited for collaborative development and code usability. Movement science project often have different aspects to them. Starting with extracting the data, some preprocessing steps, possible filtering or normalisation, the actual analysis e.g. step detection; and calculating the outcome variables. All these different components of a movement science project could be considered **modules**. When used correctly, OOP simplifies the relationships within the project, however, it might be hard to start with, as most programming is taught using a functions approach. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects you'd want to manipulate and how they relate to each other. The structure of OOP is as follows:\n",

    "2. Objects\n",
    "    - The individual objects that are generated from the blueprint\n",
    "3. Attributes\n",
    "    - The characteristics/variables that define the objects\n",
    "4. methods\n",
    "    - The functions of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is currently one of the most popular programming languages that is build around Object-Oriented Programming. The telltale use of the code has the structure of **object.method()**. For example: `my_array.max()`---find the maximum value in the array; or `my_dataframe.head()`---displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame. Here, you have the object `my_dataframe` or `my_array` that is constructed from the class Array or DataFrame and using the functionality of the methods like `max()` or `head()`, the data can be manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know a bit about OOP, we can apply this knowledge on working with data. Every object, such as a numpy, pandas or pyplot object has *methods* associated with it. **Tip:** Within Jupyter notebook you can use the TAB button to get an overview of the available methods.

    "#### NumPy\n",
    "NumPy (**N**umerical **P**ython) is the most used library for scientific computing and engineering. Even is you don't use it directly, there is a good chance that other libraries you use rely on it in the background. NumPy provides powerful multidimensional array structures (*ndarray*) and the tools for comprehensive assortment of methods that operate efficiently on those arrays including mathematical, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistics and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some essentials:\n",
    "1. ndarray has a homogenous datatype\n",
    "2. element-by-element operations are default (vectorization and broadcasting)\n",
    "3. shape of the ndarray is fixed: e.g. [] (empty) 500 (one-dimensional), 2x500 (two-dimensional), or 2x2x500 (three-dimensional)\n",
    "4. easy to pre-allocate variables `np.zeros((nrow, ncol))`\n",
    "5. fully supports Object-Oriented Programming where ndarray is the class\n",

    "Pandas is the second essential library for data science. The pandas are build on top of NumPy, and it is the easies ways to import data that is saved in text, csv, or Excel files. It has been created to work with *relational* or *labeled* data.  <br>\n",
    "Some essentials:\n",
    "1. The two primary data structures are `pandas.Series` (1D) and `pandas.DataFrame` (2D)\n",
    "2. Series and DataFrames can contain heterogeneous datatypes (e.g. col1=str (subj_id), col2=bool (female True/False), col3=int (age), col4=float (peak_knee_angle)...)\n",
    "3. Shape and size is mutable: columns can be added and deleted\n",
    "4. Powerful **group by** functions: `raw_data.group_by(\"Sex\")`\n",
    "5. label-based slicing and indexing: e.g. `data.peak_knee_angle.max()` or `data[\"peak_knee_angle\"].max()`\n",
    "6. time-series specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting, and lagging\n",
